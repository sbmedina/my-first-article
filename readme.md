Week 1) The exercise of the first week consists of selecting a current news item from an online newspaper of your choice and creating an HTML document that has the same content as the news (title, subtitles, date, text, images, links, etc.) respecting the semantic elements of HTML and saving the progress in a public Github repository. The repository link must be uploaded in response to the weekly goal before the end of the week.

Week 2) We propose to look for a new news in English, but we must pay attention to the HTML content and also to the style. The goal this week is to create a new HTML document that includes CSS styling to make the page look identical to the original newspaper when viewed. This should be done for both the new news and the one we created in week 1.
It will also be necessary to add a link to the beginning or end of each news item to navigate within the newspaper that we have created. That is, from the news of week 1 to the news of week 2 and vice versa.
Finally, you must create a README document to the repository where the URLs of the original news are explicit so that tutors can compare.
